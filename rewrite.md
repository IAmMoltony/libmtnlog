# Le Rewrite de MtnLog

I originally wrote MtnLog as part of a larger project: [ds-craft](https://iammoltony.github.io/ds-craft/index.html).
As the name suggests, it was written for the Nintendo DS, which is very different from other platforms like personal
computer. Anyway, I propose

*mtnlog v3**

The newer, cooler and overall better version of the Moltony's Logging Library.

Proposed features:

- familiar API to MtnLog 1.x and 2.x
- linkable as a .dll or .so file, allowing for bindings for different languages
- de-initialization

It'll be written entirely from scratch with the original MtnLog code as a reference.
